# Naan Mudhalvan OpenCV Projects

This repository contains OpenCV-based computer vision projects developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan training program. Each project applies image processing and AI techniques to solve real-world problems in healthcare, security, and sports.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Facial Recognition System for Security
- *Description:* Identifies or verifies individuals based on facial features for secure access control, surveillance, or identity verification.
- *Input:* Images or video streams from security cameras or webcams (RGB).
- *Output:* Face detection with bounding boxes around detected faces.

### 2. Healthcare Imaging Analysis
- *Description:* Processes medical images (such as hand X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to assist with diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring using image processing and machine learning.
- *Input:* Medical images (modalities include X-ray, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, etc.) in formats like DICOM, JPEG, PNG, TIFF.  
- *Example Input:* Hand X-ray images.
- *Output:* Detection and localization of abnormalities (e.g., lesions, tumors, fractures) using bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

### 3. Sports Performance Analysis
- *Description:* Uses video and sensor data to evaluate athletes' movements, tactics, and performance for training and strategic improvements.
- *Input:* Video footage or live feed from single or multi-camera setups during training or matches.
- *Output:* Player tracking, positioning, movement trajectories, and heatmaps over time.
